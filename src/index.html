<h1 id="what" class="ui dividing dividing header">What is Makers API?</h1>
<p><strong>Makers API is a schema for collecting standardized information about makerspaces, an API for sharing that information, and a map to browse and sort. The goal is to connect makers around the world, helping them collaborate and co-create.</strong></p>
<br>
<p>There are a growing number of makerspaces, hackerspaces, DIY shops, innovation labs, coworking spaces, tech-enabled libraries, et cetera, all around the world, filling with people working on amazing projects from Arduinos to (RPi) Zeroes.</p>
<p>So many, in fact, it's increasingly hard to keep up. When I started looking around for lists, I found them: groups compiling data in Google Sheets, JSON files, and maps and collecting a variety of information in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>Enter the Makers API project. This includes the maker.json schema, a small file you put at the root of website or at a public repository, storing standardized information about your space, its status, who is involved, what kind of tools are available, and where people can learn more. Think of it as a structured "README" file.</p>
<p>What does it look like? <a href="/example">Check out an example of the maker.json specification.</a></p>
<p>From there, we've taken the first step in standardizing the information collected from so many other groups to this format, and built a structured API around this schema.</p>

        <p>This is no good unless people use it (I.. also really don't want to have to write conversion scripts). Big plans in store and would love to talk to folks about what it would take to adopt this. Or did you? Please let me know!</p>

<h2 id="who" class="ui dividing header">Who is behind this?</h2>
<p>maker.json was originally created by <a href="http://rrbaker.com">Rob Baker</a> in June 2016 to help establish and improve global networks of makers. After inquiring within his network for location data and details, ultimately seeking good case studies, other than what larger establishments such as WeWork and FabLab provided the lists he dug up were ad hoc and questionable on how up-to-date was the information provided.</p>
<p>This project borrows heavily (and gratefully) from <a href="https://github.com/BetaNYC/civic.json">civic.json</a>, a similar initiative originally created by BetaNYC in 2014 as "a metadata standard for civic technology projects that is intended to complement project information in a github repository." Additionally, and including this website, we've taken from <a href="http://open.dc.gov/civic.json/">contributions from the Code for DC volunteers and employees of the Washington DC District Government,</a> extending this specification to make it useful for a broader user base. A big thanks to those teams for their work and inspiration.</p>
